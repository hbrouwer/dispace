# Each unit i of a Competitive Layer is assigned a weight vector, with
# a weight for each basic event e in the microworld. In addition, each unit
# i is assigned a single bias unit b_i.  Weights are initially set to 0.5,
# and biases to 1. The resulting Competitive Layer is then trained for
# N epochs. During each epoch, the following procedure is repeated for each
# obsveration Sk:
#
# (1) For each unit i, the cityblock distance is determined between the
#     weight vector assigned to unit i, and observation Sk:
#
#          dist(u_i,Sk) = sum_a|u_i(a) - Sk(a)|
#
# (2) The unit w with the shortest, biased distance to Sk(a) is determined:
#
#          w = argmin_i(dist(u_i,Sk) - b_i)
#
# (3) The weight vector of unit w (the winner) is updated:
#
#          Du_w = alpha * (Sk - u_w)
#
#     where alpha is a learning rate parameter.
#
# (4) The bias of unit w (the winner) is decreased (to a minimum of 1):
#
#          Db_w = beta * b_w(1 - b_w)
#
#     where beta is a learning rate parameter.
#
# (5) The biases of all other units (i != w; the losers) are increased:
#
#          Db_i = beta * b_i
#
# The above is adapted from:

# Frank, S. L., Haselager, W. F. G., and van Rooij, I. (2009). Connectionist
#     semantic systematicity. Cognition, 110(3):358â€“379.
#
# Note: in the present implementation, alpha and beta are scaled after each
#     training epoch
