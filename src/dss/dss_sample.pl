%% sample_event_states(+UndecidedEvents,-DecidedEvents)
%
%  Samples the states of all basic events in the microworld. A state of
%  a random event is toggled to be either the case or not (depending on its
%  probability given the unfolding state of affairs), and on the basis of
%  the updated state of affairs, we then try to infer as many other event
%  states as possible.  This is procedure is repeated until no more events
%  have undecided state.
%
%  The state of an event E is certain if either its being the case or not
%  being the case can be uniquely determined. This is established by
%  generating a state of affairs S1 in which event E is the case, and
%  a state of affairs S2 in which it is not the case, and then verifying
%  these states of affairs with respect to world knowledge. There are four
%  possible outcomes:
% 
%  (1) S1 and S2 are both consistent with world knowledge: The state of
%  event E is not certain, and cannot be inferred.
% 
%  (2) Only S1 is consistent with world knowledge: E is inferred to be the
%  case, meaning that S1 is the new state of affairs.
% 
%  (3) Only S2 is consistent with world knowledge: E is inferred not to be
%  the case, meaning that S2 is the new state of affairs.
%
%  (4) Neither S1 nor S2 is consistent with world knowledge: The state of
%  affairs before trying to infer E is in conflict with world knowledge.
